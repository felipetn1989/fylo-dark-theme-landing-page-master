## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

When using .match and .test functions to test regEx, .match returns either null or the mathed string, while .test returns true or false. At first I was trying to put .match in my JS if condition, thinking it would return true or false. After I realized the problem, changed it to .test and it worked correctly.
